# Counting-faces-in-image
Here I will be counting faces present in images... to run this code at your end you want those 3 images and .py file in same folder... 

This program will also mail the user the count, so one need to write email id, password.
You also need to allow py program to send the mail using python by going here "https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps" and changing security
